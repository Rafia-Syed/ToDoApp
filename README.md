# to_do_app
𝑯𝒆𝒍𝒍𝒐 𝑪𝒐𝒎𝒎𝒖𝒏𝒊𝒕𝒚,

I am excited to share a recent project from my previous semester where we integrated a database with software. For this, I chose to work with Flutter and DBMS, marking my first venture into database management systems.

Under the guidance of Sir Zaeem Tariq, I developed a ToDo App 📱 that utilizes the Sqflite plugin for Flutter, implementing the core principles of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

I hope this project showcases my growing skills in software development and database management.

Looking forward to your feedback! 👍
